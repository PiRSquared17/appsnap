  AppSnap GUI from locking up.

GUI Enhancements
- Checked applications are now unchecked as they are successfully installed or
  uninstalled. If the install/uninstall fails for any reason, the application
  will remain checked.

Internal Improvements
- As recommended by R. Francis Smith, new applications can be added or existing
  applications modified by making an entry in userdb.ini. This way, changes made
  by the user are not lost through database updates.
- Added support for MSI packages.
- Added support for applications which do not disclose their versions such as
  Google WebAccelerator and Desktop.
- Category and section sorts are now done case insensitively so that iTunes and
  uTorrent can show up in the right order.
- Added DOTTOUNDERSCORE_VERSION to convert 2.72 versions to 2_72.
- Changed default install directory in config.ini to environment variable 
  %ProgramFiles% which points to the Windows "Program Files" directory.
- When run with -d, the GUI now logs debugging information to debug.log.

Bug Fixes
- If install/uninstall failed for whatever reason, AppSnap still assumed that
  everything worked fine. We now check the return codes of the installer and
  fail if non-zero.
- Reload function was not deleting all process objects which were retaining the
  configuration loaded previously.
- Uninstallation was using the latest version of an application instead of the
  installed version during version text replacements. If installed version is
  not available, the latest version is used.

- Older versions of an application's installer are now deleted when a newer
  version is downloaded.
- Details about adding new entries to the database can now be found in DB.txt.
- Added referer when downloading applications. If not explicitly specified in
  db.ini, the scrape URL is used as the referer.
- Download URL is now optional and defaults to the scrape URL.
- Added DASHTODOT_VERSION to convert 1-1-1 versions to 1.1.1.
- Added MAJOR_VERSION to convert 3.8 to 3.

Bug Fixes

  version had fewer digits than a previous version. E.g. For Firefox, 2.0 had
  two digits compared to version 1.5.0.7 with four digits.
- Fixed bug where HTTP response codes other than 200 were being treated as
  failed. This has been changed to codes >= 300.

  uninstall command string causing uninstalls to fail.
