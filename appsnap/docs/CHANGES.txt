Version 1.2
-----------
New Applications
- Entertainment : iTunes
- Internet : uTorrent, Google WebAccelerator, Xming
- Productivity: AbiWord, Google Desktop, Paint.NET, PDFCreator, Picasa
- Utilities : Command Prompt Here, Stickies
- Development : ActivePerl, InnoSetup, NSIS, Python, PyCurl, PyYAML, wxPython,
                XAMPP

GUI Enhancements
- Checked applications are now unchecked as they are successfully installed or
  uninstalled. If the install/uninstall fails for any reason, the application
  will remain checked.

Internal Improvements
- As recommended by R. Francis Smith, new applications can be added or existing
  applications modified by making an entry in userdb.ini. This way, changes made
  by the user are not lost through database updates.
- Added support for MSI packages.
- Added support for applications which do not disclose their versions such as
  Google WebAccelerator and Desktop.
- Category and section sorts are now done case insensitively so that iTunes and
  uTorrent can show up in the right order.
- Added DOTTOUNDERSCORE_VERSION to convert 2.72 versions to 2_72.

Bug Fixes
- If install/uninstall failed for whatever reason, AppSnap still assumed that
  everything worked fine. We now check the return codes of the installer and
  fail if non-zero.
- Reload function was not deleting all process objects which were retaining the
  configuration loaded previously.
- Uninstallation was using the latest version of an application instead of the
  installed version during version text replacements. If installed version is
  not available, the latest version is used.

GUI Enhancements
- Replaced install/uninstall buttons with a nice toolbar.

- Added an update database button that gets latest version of db.ini from SVN.
- AppSnap can now reload the configuration by clicking the reload button.
- All installed applications can be filtered by selecting the 'Installed'
  category in the dropdown menu.
- Increased default width and height of GUI to fit toolbar and more applications.

CLI Enhancements
- Update database with the latest version of db.ini from SVN using -U.
- Filter all installed applications using filter -f Installed.

Internal Improvements
- AppSnap now remembers the application versions that it installs.
- Older versions of an application's installer are now deleted when a newer
  version is downloaded.
- Details about adding new entries to the database can now be found in DB.txt.
- Added referer when downloading applications. If not explicitly specified in
  db.ini, the scrape URL is used as the referer.
- Download URL is now optional and defaults to the scrape URL.
- Added DASHTODOT_VERSION to convert 1-1-1 versions to 1.1.1.
- Added MAJOR_VERSION to convert 3.8 to 3.
- Simplified process.get_width().

Bug Fixes
- Fixed bug where file version filtering algorithm was failing if the latest
  version had fewer digits than a previous version. E.g. For Firefox, 2.0 had
  two digits compared to version 1.5.0.7 with four digits.
- Fixed bug where HTTP response codes other than 200 were being treated as
  failed. This has been changed to codes >= 300.
- Fixed bug in uninstall code where spurious \ was being introduced into the
  uninstall command string causing uninstalls to fail.
- Added a Yield() during installs to update the progress bar after a download.
- Fixed GUI resize code to fit list and outline in window.
- Updated scrape URL for Firefox.
