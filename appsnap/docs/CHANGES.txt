Internal Improvements
- Simplified process.get_width().
- Added DASHTODOT_VERSION to convert 1-1-1 versions to 1.1.1.
- Added MAJOR_VERSION to convert 3.8 to 3.
- Added referer when downloading applications. If not explicitly specified in db.ini,
  the scrape URL is used as the referer.
- Older versions of an application's installer are now deleted when a newer version is
  downloaded.

Bug Fixes
- Fixed bug where file version filtering algorithm was failing if the latest version
  had fewer digits than a previous version. E.g. For Firefox, 2.0 had two digits
  compared to version 1.5.0.7 with four digits.
- Fixed bug where HTTP response codes other than 200 were being treated as failed. This
  has been changed to codes >= 300.
- Fixed bug in uninstall code where spurious \ was being introduced into the uninstall
  command string causing uninstalls to fail.
- Added a Yield() during installs to update the progress bar after a download.
- Fixed GUI resize code to fit list and outline in window.
- Updated scrape URL for Firefox.
