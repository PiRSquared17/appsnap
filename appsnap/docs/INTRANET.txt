AppSnap Intranet Setup
----------------------

AppSnap can prove useful in deploying applications across multiple machines 
in an intranet. In such a configuration, a central server with AppSnap 
installed will download all the required version information and installers 
to the AppSnap cache folder. This cache folder can then be shared across the 
network for remote instances of AppSnap to connect to and download from.

AppSnap Repository
------------------

AppSnap should be installed on a primary server with access to the internet 
as well as the intranet. An application repository can be created on the 
command line as follows:-

  appsnap -n * -d

This will query and cache the latest version and installer of every application 
supported by AppSnap. If every single application does not need to be cached 
then the list of applications can be specified comma separated instead of *.
For example:-

  appsnap -n AppSnap,FileZilla,Firefox,Thunderbird -d

The above actions can also be performed on the GUI by selecting every application 
of interest and clicking on download. Once the repository has been created, the 
AppSnap cache folder should be setup as a Windows shared folder that every intranet 
client can access.

AppSnap Clients
---------------

In order for the AppSnap clients to access this application repository, the 
following needs to be changed in the config.ini file for each client under the 
[cache] section:-

  cache_location = file:\\primary_server\appsnap_shared_cache_folder
  cache_timeout = 1000

What this does is instructs AppSnap on the client machines to use the remote 
cache folder as their own cache folder. This way, each client has access to the 
latest version information and installers as maintained by the primary server. 
The cache timeout essentially tells the client to respect the cached information 
for a long time (1000 days).

We also need to ensure that the AppSnap clients can keep their application databases 
up to date without access to the internet. This can be achieved by the following 
change to config.ini under the [database] section:

  location = file:\\primary_server\appsnap_shared_cache_folder\db.ini

As the primary server updates its own database, the clients will also be able to 
keep up with the changes.
