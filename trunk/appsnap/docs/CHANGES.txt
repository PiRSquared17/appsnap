Bug Fixes
- Fixed bug where file version filtering algorithm was failing if the latest
  version had fewer digits than a previous version. E.g. For Firefox, 2.0 had
  two digits compared to version 1.5.0.7 with four digits.
- Fixed bug where HTTP response codes other than 200 were being treated as
  failed. This has been changed to codes >= 300.
- Fixed bug in uninstall code where spurious \ was being introduced into the
  uninstall command string causing uninstalls to fail.
- Added a Yield() during installs to update the progress bar after a download.
- Fixed GUI resize code to fit list and outline in window.
- Updated scrape URL for Firefox.
